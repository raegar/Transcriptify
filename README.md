# Transcriptify
Utilises YouTube's Closed Captions where available to return a searchable transcript of the video.

Copy and paste a Youtube.com or youtu.be link into the address bar to load a video and then press Transcriptify to return the full transcript of the video in plain text. A rudimentary search function is provided to help locate key terms in the video and it is possible to then load the video at the location selected in the transcript.

Tested and fully working on Windows 7. An issue exisits in Windows 10 where the C# webbrowser control does not always load flash content. In this instance the transcript will still load and is searchable but you will be unable to use the Go To Line feature.
